Doherty's Robotics Club Website

This website is meant for the purpose of Doherty students, staff, and as well as family members to 
further engage in club awareness, such as its weekly news, past news, information about the club, 
latest updates on each team's robots, club events like fundraisers, our officer positions, and much more!

It will be most beneficial if people miss our stories posted on our instagram page. They cna just hop on
to the website through a link in our bio and BOOM!

I hope that this website can also contribute into attracting newer club members as the Doherty Clubs page 
lacks info. This website is meant to be an improvement of it.
