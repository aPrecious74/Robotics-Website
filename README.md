Doherty's Robotics Club Website

This website is meant for Doherty students, staff, and as well as family members to 
further engage in club awareness, such as its weekly news, past news, information about the club, 
latest updates on each team's robots, club events like fundraisers, our officer positions, and much more!

It will be most beneficial to people who miss out on our stories posted on our Instagram page. They can just hop on
to the website through a link in our bio and BOOM!
It poses as a secondary Instagram page for anyone who does not or can not have Instagram. The web is a 
download-free space to Robotics!

I hope that this website can also contribute to attracting newer club members as the Doherty Clubs page 
lacks info. This website is meant to be an improvement of it.
